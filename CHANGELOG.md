# Changelog

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-18

Scrollbar and ResourceBrowser fixes.

### Fixed
- **Scrollbar CSS rewrite** — removed `scrollbar-color` property that caused Chrome 121+ to ignore `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-elements, resulting in gray 15px default scrollbars instead of 6px violet
- **`.openshiftpulse` class missing from DOM** — all custom scrollbar CSS was scoped to this class but it was never applied to the Shell root element
- **ResourceBrowser scroll** — added `flex flex-col` to sidebar container and wrapped views + dashboards + resource groups in a single scrollable body so users can scroll through all content
- **ResourceBrowser `min-h-0`** — prevents flexbox from refusing to shrink below content height

### Stats
- **1,942 tests** across 162 test files
- Selector routing: 55/55 (100%)
- Release gate: all 15 scenarios PASS

## [5.8.0] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Silent catch blocks** — replaced 8 empty `catch {}` blocks with proper error surfacing via toasts or console warnings; OperatorCatalog now only swallows 409 Conflict
- **Clipboard copy feedback** — PromQL copy in AlertsView no longer shows success toast on failure; all clipboard operations use shared `copyToClipboard()` helper
- **window.prompt replaced** — Add Label dialog uses styled modal with separate key/value inputs instead of native `window.prompt()`
- **RBAC dead ends** — disabled buttons now show tooltips explaining missing permissions instead of being hidden
- **ErrorBoundary contextual messages** — categorizes errors as network/chunk/render with contextual recovery suggestions

### Added
- **WelcomeView error recovery** — cluster connection errors now show Retry button, proxy hint, and Administration link
- **WelcomeView capabilities** — all 13 capabilities visible by default, all clickable (no more dead-end rows)
- **TableView empty states** — enriched with EmptyState component, RBAC-gated Create button, namespace hints
- **TableView filtered empty state** — shows "0 of N match" with active filter summary

## [5.3.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Claude Harness** — optimizations for getting the most out of the agent:
  - Dynamic Tool Selection: 8 categories (diagnostics, workloads, networking, security, storage, monitoring, operations, gitops), reduces 54→15-25 tools per query
  - Prompt Caching: system prompt + runbooks cached via `cache_control: ephemeral` (~90% cost reduction)
  - Cluster Context Injection: pre-fetches node count, namespaces, OCP version, failing pods, firing alerts (saves 2-3 tool calls)
  - Component Rendering Hints: guides Claude to focus on analysis, not data formatting
- **Version Contract** — `/version` endpoint returns protocol version, tool count, features; UI warns on mismatch
- **Deploy Script** (`deploy/deploy.sh`) — single command deploys both Pulse UI + Agent with matching auth tokens
- **Integration Test** (`deploy/integration-test.sh`) — 13-check verification: pods, health, version, tools, WS auth, nginx proxy, OAuth, Vertex AI, NetworkPolicy
- **HTML Dashboard Rendering** — agent-generated HTML renders in sandboxed iframe with expand/minimize
- **Build Cancel Button** — stop icon on running/pending builds, patches `status.cancelled: true`

### Fixed
- **WebSocket auth** — nginx injects WS token at proxy level (not via JS sub_filter)
- **nginx resolver** — static proxy_pass for WS locations (no variable-based routing)
- **Build logs** — uses OpenShift Build API instead of Pod API
- **Browser performance** — streaming deltas batched via requestAnimationFrame, MessageBubble memoized
- **SSRF IPv6** — dev proxy blocks IPv6 loopback, mapped, unique local, link-local

### Stats
- **1472 tests** across 97 test files
- **17 views**, 45+ routes
- **54 agent tools** with dynamic selection harness
- **0 package CVEs**, all Red Hat UBI images
- **13-check integration test** for deployment verification

## [5.2.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Dynamic UI Generation** — Agent tools render rich interactive components inline in chat:
  - `ComponentSpec` protocol: data_table, info_card_grid, badge_list, status_list, key_value, chart
  - `AgentComponentRenderer` maps specs to existing primitives (DataTable, InfoCard, Badge, MetricsChart)
  - `MarkdownRenderer` for text responses (headers, bold, code blocks, lists) — no external dependency
  - 4 tools enhanced: `list_pods`, `list_deployments`, `get_events`, `top_pods_by_restarts` return structured tables
  - Auto-colored status/severity columns in rendered tables
  - New WebSocket event type: `component` with tool-emitted specs
- **Cancel/Stop button** — Red square button (or Escape key) aborts running agent queries, saves partial response
- **Edit last message** — Pencil button loads last user message back into input for re-submission
- **Build logs** — Uses OpenShift Build API (`/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/.../builds/{name}/log`) instead of Pod API

### Fixed
- **Browser memory/performance** — Streaming deltas batched via `requestAnimationFrame` instead of per-token re-renders; `MessageBubble` wrapped in `React.memo`; message history capped at 100 in memory / 50 persisted
- **SSRF IPv6 bypass** — Dev proxy helmrepo endpoint now blocks IPv6 loopback, IPv4-mapped, unique local, and link-local addresses
- **Helm values** — Added `agent.serviceName` default to prevent template rendering error
- **Build log 404s** — Build view was fetching pod logs for build names; now uses correct Build API endpoint

### Stats
- **1472 tests** across 97 test files
- **17 views**, 45+ routes
- **54 agent tools** with 4 returning rich UI component specs
- **0 package CVEs**, all Red Hat UBI images

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **HyperShift / Hosted Control Plane support** — Auto-detects hosted clusters via Infrastructure resource (`controlPlaneTopology: External`). Adapts health checks, production readiness, and compute view for hosted control plane model.
- **Persistent topology badge** — "Hosted" pill in CommandBar visible on every view when running on a HyperShift cluster.
- **"Hosted Control Plane" badge** on Pulse daily briefing with tooltip explaining the hosting model.
- **Control Plane InfoCard** in Admin overview showing topology type (Hosted/Self-managed) and API server URL.
- **Snapshot topology tracking** — `controlPlaneTopology` captured in cluster snapshots and included in diff comparisons.
- **Prerequisites section** in README with OCP, Node.js, oc CLI, and browser requirements.

### Changed
- **Health checks adapted for HyperShift** — HA Control Plane, MachineHealthChecks, and Cluster Autoscaling checks skip on hosted clusters (irrelevant when CP is external). Production Readiness shows "Hosted Control Plane: Managed externally" as auto-pass.
- **Etcd backup check** auto-passes on HyperShift with "Managed by hosting provider" instead of SSH backup instructions.
- **Worker Nodes check** threshold adjusted to 1+ on HyperShift (vs 2+ on traditional) since all nodes are workers.
- **Machine Management section** hidden on HyperShift ComputeView with info block explaining NodePool model.
- **Machine API queries gated** — Machines, MachineSets, MachineHealthChecks, MachineAutoscalers, and ClusterAutoscaler queries disabled on HyperShift clusters (`enabled: !isHyperShift`) to avoid unnecessary API calls.
- **AdminView** unified to read `isHyperShift` from `useClusterStore` instead of deriving locally, matching all other views.
- **Create button hidden** for Nodes in resource browser (nodes are provisioned via MachineSet/NodePool, not created directly).
- **README rewritten** — Added 10 previously undocumented features, fixed stale test/health check counts, added all keyboard shortcuts, added prerequisites section.

### Fixed
- Control plane operator list on Pulse no longer shows missing operators as broken on HyperShift — only shows operators that actually exist in the cluster.
- Health check count corrected from 67 to 76 (Security view's 9 checks were previously uncounted).

### Stats
- **1162 tests** across 63 test files (up from 1128/61 in v4.0.0)
- **76 health checks** (31 cluster + 45 domain)
- **13 views**, 35 routes
