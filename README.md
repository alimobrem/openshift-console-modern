## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24+** and **pnpm** — for building the UI
- **OpenShift 4.14+** or **ROSA** — with OAuth proxy support
- **Podman** or **Docker** — for building container images
- **Helm 3+** — for deployment
- **oc CLI** — logged into target cluster
- **Container registry** — writable push access (Quay.io, Docker Hub, etc.)

### Fork & Deploy Checklist

If you're deploying your own instance, here's what to change:

| What | Where | Default | Change to |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Container registry** | env vars or Helm values | `quay.io/amobrem` | Your registry (e.g., `quay.io/your-org`) |
| **Claude API** | env var or Helm secret | none | Your Anthropic API key or GCP Vertex AI project |
| **CI image push** | `.github/workflows/` | `quay.io/amobrem` | Your registry |
| **GitHub Pages** | `docs/index.html` | `alimobrem.github.io` | Your GitHub Pages URL |

Everything else (RBAC, OAuth, WS tokens, PostgreSQL) is auto-configured by the deploy script.

```bash
# 1. Set your registry
export PULSE_UI_IMAGE=your-registry.io/your-org/openshiftpulse
export PULSE_AGENT_IMAGE=your-registry.io/your-org/pulse-agent

# 2. Set your Claude API credentials (pick one)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...                    # Anthropic direct
# OR
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project    # Vertex AI

# 3. Login and deploy
oc login https://api.your-cluster:6443
podman login your-registry.io
./deploy/deploy.sh
```

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Connect to your cluster
oc login https://api.your-cluster:6443
oc proxy --port=8001 &

# 3. Start dev server (rspack, hot reload)
pnpm dev    # http://localhost:9000
```

### Build & Deploy to Cluster

The `deploy.sh` script handles the full pipeline:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ pnpm build  │ ──▶ │ podman build │ ──▶ │ podman push  │ ──▶ │ helm     │
│ (rspack)    │     │ (UI + Agent) │     │ (registry)   │     │ upgrade  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────┘
```

**What happens under the hood:**
1. **`pnpm build`** — rspack production build → `dist/`
2. **`podman build`** — builds UI image (nginx + dist/) and Agent image (Python + sre_agent/) in parallel
3. **`podman push`** — pushes both images to your registry (default: `quay.io/amobrem`)
4. **`helm upgrade`** — deploys via umbrella chart (UI + Agent + PostgreSQL)
5. **Health check** — waits for pods to be ready, verifies agent responds

```bash
# Full build + deploy (UI + Agent)
./deploy/deploy.sh

# Preview without applying
./deploy/deploy.sh --dry-run

# Custom registry
PULSE_UI_IMAGE=my-registry.io/pulse-ui PULSE_AGENT_IMAGE=my-registry.io/pulse-agent ./deploy/deploy.sh

# Uninstall everything
./deploy/deploy.sh --uninstall
```

**Required logins before deploy:**
```bash
oc login https://api.your-cluster:6443      # OpenShift cluster
podman login quay.io                         # Container registry
```

## Deploy to OpenShift

> **Requires `cluster-admin`** — creates ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, OAuthClient.

### One-Command Deploy (UI + Agent)

```bash
# Option A: Vertex AI (GCP)
ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5 \
  ./deploy/deploy.sh --gcp-key ~/sa-key.json

# Option B: Anthropic API (no GCP needed)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... ./deploy/deploy.sh

# Verify
./deploy/integration-test.sh
```

**How it works**: Uses an **umbrella Helm chart** (`deploy/helm/pulse/`) that deploys both UI and agent as subcharts in a single `helm upgrade --install --atomic`. The deploy script auto-detects the agent repo (looks for `../pulse-agent` by default). Builds images locally with Podman, pushes to Quay.io, deploys atomically with auto-rollback on failure. A values file replaces 20+ `--set` flags. Never uses S2I or on-cluster builds.

**Deploy tracking**: Every deploy records duration timing and writes to a local history log (`~/.pulse-deploy-history.jsonl`). A ConfigMap with deploy metadata is written to the cluster. Optional `--slack-webhook` sends notifications on success/failure.

**Startup probes**: All 4 containers (oauth-proxy, nginx, agent, postgresql) have startup probes for reliable rollout detection.

**Self-monitoring**: A ServiceMonitor and 4 PrometheusRules (UIDown, AgentDown, AgentHighRestarts, PostgreSQLDown) are deployed by default.

**Rollback**: `--rollback` flag reverts to the previous Helm release. Failed health checks trigger automatic rollback.

**Session persistence**: OAuth cookie (168h TTL) and client secrets are generated once and persisted in-cluster. Subsequent `helm upgrade` runs reuse existing secrets via `lookup()`, so users are never logged out on redeploy.

**WS token**: Stored as a Kubernetes Secret (not ConfigMap). The umbrella chart owns the shared WS token secret. Both the agent (via `secretKeyRef`) and the UI nginx proxy (via Helm `lookup()`) reference the same secret. No manual token management.

**Build context**: `.dockerignore` reduces frontend build context from ~500MB to ~5MB.

**Other features**: `--dry-run` to preview, `--uninstall` to clean up, `--rollback` to revert. Images tagged with git SHA for rollback safety. Proxy chain health check validates connectivity end-to-end.

**Prerequisites**: `oc` (logged in), `helm`, `pnpm`, `podman` (logged in to your registry).

### Helm Charts

| Chart | Path | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **pulse** (umbrella) | `deploy/helm/pulse/` | Single install for UI + Agent |
| openshiftpulse | `deploy/helm/openshiftpulse/` | UI only (standalone) |
| openshift-sre-agent | `pulse-agent/chart/` | Agent only (standalone) |

### Quick Redeploy

```bash
# UI only (skip agent rebuild)
pnpm build && podman build --platform linux/amd64 -t ${PULSE_UI_IMAGE:-quay.io/your-org/openshiftpulse}:latest . \
  && podman push ${PULSE_UI_IMAGE:-quay.io/your-org/openshiftpulse}:latest \
  && oc rollout restart deployment/openshiftpulse -n openshiftpulse

# Config-only change (no rebuild)
./deploy/deploy.sh --rollback
```

### Uninstall

```bash
./deploy/deploy.sh --uninstall
```

### Security

OAuth proxy with per-user auth. Non-root containers, read-only filesystem, CSP headers, TLS verification. 15/15 audit findings resolved. 0 npm CVEs. All images from Red Hat registries. Secret rotation procedures documented. See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** for full details.

<details>
<summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| 503 on login | Delete TLS secret, re-add `serving-cert-secret-name` annotation |
| 403 on API calls | OAuthClient needs `user:full` in `scopeRestrictions` |
| oauth-proxy crash (tokenreviews) | ClusterRole needs tokenreviews/subjectaccessreviews — re-apply manifests |
| cookie_secret error | Regenerate with `openssl rand -hex 16` (not base64) |
| Metrics blank (SSL error) | Use `service-ca.crt` (not `ca.crt`) for Prometheus/Alertmanager |
| Build stuck | Check configmap quota (`oc get resourcequota`) — need headroom (set >=50) |
| Pods not scheduling | Need 2+ nodes for topology spread constraints |

</details>

---

## Development

```bash
pnpm install         # Install dependencies
cp .env.example .env # Configure cluster URLs (optional)
oc proxy --port=8001 & # Start API proxy
pnpm dev             # Dev server on port 9000
pnpm test            # Run test suite (1908 tests)
pnpm build           # Production build (~1s)
pnpm type-check      # TypeScript checking
pnpm verify          # Full check: types + lint + test + build
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `K8S_API_URL` | `http://localhost:8001` | K8s API proxy target |
| `THANOS_URL` | *(disabled)* | Thanos Querier for Prometheus metrics |
| `ALERTMANAGER_URL` | *(disabled)* | Alertmanager for alert management |
| `PULSE_AGENT_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Pulse Agent API server for AI diagnostics |
