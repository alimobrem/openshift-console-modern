## Features

### Health Audits (36 Domain Checks + 31 Cluster Checks = 67 Total)
Each overview view has an expandable audit with score %, per-resource pass/fail, "Why it matters" explanations, YAML fix examples, and direct "Edit YAML" links.

- **Workloads (6)**: Resource limits, liveness probes, readiness probes, PDBs, replicas, rolling update strategy
- **Storage (6)**: Default StorageClass, PVC binding, reclaim policy, WaitForFirstConsumer, volume snapshots, storage quotas
- **Networking (6)**: Route TLS, network policies, NodePort avoidance, ingress controller health, route admission, egress policies
- **Compute (6)**: HA control plane, dedicated workers, MachineHealthChecks, node pressure, kubelet version consistency, cluster autoscaling
- **Access Control (6)**: Default SA privileges, overprivileged bindings, wildcard rules, stale bindings, namespace isolation, automount tokens
- **Identity (6)**: Identity providers, kubeadmin removal, cluster-admin audit, SA privileges, inactive users, group membership

### Workload Health on Detail Views
Every Deployment, StatefulSet, and DaemonSet detail view shows per-container health checks: resource limits, resource requests, liveness probes, readiness probes, HA replicas, update strategy, and security context (runAsNonRoot, privilege escalation, capabilities). Expandable rows show probe descriptions.

### Builds
BuildConfigs with one-click trigger, average build duration, last build status. Builds table with status, strategy, duration, timestamps. In-progress and failed builds panels. ImageStreams with tag badges.

### Cluster Config (10 Editable Sections)
OAuth, Proxy, Image, Ingress, Scheduler, API Server (full editors). DNS (warning: breaks routing), Network (warning: cluster disruption), FeatureGate (warning: irreversible), Console (product name, logo, route, statuspage).

### Cluster Upgrades
Pre-update checklist (nodes ready, operators healthy, channel, etcd backup, PDBs), ClusterVersion conditions (Progressing/Failing banners), version skip indicators, risk badges, duration estimates, per-operator update progress during rolling upgrade, history with duration.

### Operator Catalog & Lifecycle
Browse 500+ operators. One-click install with 4-step progress tracking. Post-install guidance for 9+ operators. Full uninstall flow. Channel selector, namespace auto-suggestion.

### Alerts & Silence Management
Severity filters (Critical/Warning/Info), group by namespace or alertname, firing duration display, silenced indicators, runbook links, silence creation from any alert, silence expiration with confirmation.

### User Management & Impersonation
Users, groups, service accounts with role bindings. One-click impersonation — all API requests include `Impersonate-User` headers. Amber banner shows active impersonation across all views.

### Auto-Generated Resource Tables
Every resource type gets sortable columns, search, per-column filters, bulk delete, keyboard navigation (j/k), CSV/JSON export, Edit YAML + Delete on every row, and inline scale controls for deployments.

### Smart Diagnosis with Log Analysis
10 error patterns detected from pod logs: Permission denied, Connection refused, OOM, DNS failure, read-only filesystem, wrong architecture — each with specific fix suggestions.

### YAML Editor
CodeMirror with K8s autocomplete, YAML linting, Schema panel (from CRD OpenAPI), 71 context-aware sub-snippets (insert at cursor), 30 full resource templates, inline diff view, keyboard shortcuts help.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Log in to your cluster
oc login --server=https://api.your-cluster.example.com:6443

# Start the API proxy
oc proxy --port=8001 &

# Copy the env example and configure for your cluster (optional — needed for Prometheus/Alertmanager proxying)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your cluster's Thanos and Alertmanager route URLs

# Start the dev server (port 9000)
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:9000. Clear `openshiftpulse-ui-storage` from localStorage on first run to get default pinned tabs.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `K8S_API_URL` | No | `http://localhost:8001` | K8s API proxy target (via `oc proxy`) |
| `THANOS_URL` | No | *(disabled)* | Thanos Querier route URL for Prometheus proxy |
| `ALERTMANAGER_URL` | No | *(disabled)* | Alertmanager route URL |
| `CONSOLE_URL` | No | *(auto-detected)* | OpenShift Console URL for Helm API proxy |
| `OC_TOKEN` | No | *(auto-detected)* | Override for `oc whoami -t` token |

## Deploy to OpenShift

### First-time setup

```bash
# Log in to your cluster
oc login --server=https://api.your-cluster.example.com:6443

# Generate OAuth secrets
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n' > /tmp/oauth-client-secret
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n' > /tmp/cookie-secret

# Create the secrets in the cluster
oc create namespace openshiftpulse
oc create secret generic openshiftpulse-oauth-secrets \
  --from-file=client-secret=/tmp/oauth-client-secret \
  --from-file=cookie-secret=/tmp/cookie-secret \
  -n openshiftpulse

# Apply deployment manifests (creates Namespace, ServiceAccount, RBAC,
# OAuthClient, ConfigMap, Deployment, PDB, Service, Route)
oc apply -f deploy/deployment.yaml

# Patch the OAuthClient with the generated client secret
oc patch oauthclient openshiftpulse \
  -p "{\"secret\":\"$(cat /tmp/oauth-client-secret)\"}"

# Create a BuildConfig for binary builds
oc new-build --binary --name=openshiftpulse --to=openshiftpulse:latest -n openshiftpulse

# Update the OAuthClient redirectURI to match your cluster's route
ROUTE=$(oc get route openshiftpulse -n openshiftpulse -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
oc patch oauthclient openshiftpulse --type merge \
  -p "{\"redirectURIs\":[\"https://${ROUTE}/oauth/callback\"]}"

# Clean up temp files
rm /tmp/oauth-client-secret /tmp/cookie-secret
```

### Build and deploy

```bash
# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Build container image and push to internal registry
oc start-build openshiftpulse --from-dir=. --follow -n openshiftpulse

# Restart pods to pick up the new image
oc rollout restart deployment/openshiftpulse -n openshiftpulse
```

### Quick redeploy (one-liner)

```bash
npm run build && oc start-build openshiftpulse --from-dir=. --follow -n openshiftpulse && oc rollout restart deployment/openshiftpulse -n openshiftpulse
```

### Security Model

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **User authentication** | OAuth proxy sidecar with OAuthClient (`user:full` scope) |
| **User authorization** | User's OAuth token forwarded via `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` header to K8s API |
| **Service account** | Minimal read-only ClusterRole (`openshiftpulse-reader`) — only used as pod identity |
| **Secrets** | OAuth client secret and cookie secret mounted from a K8s Secret via files |
| **Container security** | runAsNonRoot, drop ALL capabilities, seccomp RuntimeDefault |
| **TLS** | Auto-generated by OpenShift service-ca, reencrypt route termination |

### What the deployment includes

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **OAuth proxy** | Sidecar with explicit OAuthClient, `user:full` scope, per-user authentication |
| **nginx** | Reverse proxy forwarding user's `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` to K8s API, Prometheus, Alertmanager |
| **2 replicas** | PodDisruptionBudget (minAvailable: 1), topology spread across nodes |
| **Zero-downtime** | RollingUpdate with maxUnavailable: 0 |
| **Minimal RBAC** | Scoped ClusterRole with read-only access — user actions use the user's own token |

### Troubleshooting

- **503 on login page**: Delete the TLS secret and re-add the `serving-cert-secret-name` annotation on the Service to trigger service-ca regeneration
- **403 on API calls**: Ensure the OAuthClient has `user:full` in `scopeRestrictions` — SA-based OAuth clients cannot use this scope
- **Build stuck/pending**: Check configmap quota (`oc get resourcequota -n openshiftpulse`) — builds need headroom for temp configmaps (set ≥50)
- **Pods not scheduling**: Check PDB and topology constraints — need ≥2 nodes for topology spread

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run type-check    # TypeScript checking
```
