## Features

### Health Audits (45 Domain Checks + 31 Cluster Checks = 76 Total)
Each overview view has an expandable audit with score %, per-resource pass/fail, "Why it matters" explanations, YAML fix examples, and direct "Edit YAML" links.

- **Workloads (6)**: Resource limits, liveness probes, readiness probes, PDBs, replicas, rolling update strategy
- **Storage (6)**: Default StorageClass, PVC binding, reclaim policy, WaitForFirstConsumer, volume snapshots, storage quotas
- **Networking (6)**: Route TLS, network policies, NodePort avoidance, ingress controller health, route admission, egress policies
- **Compute (6)**: HA control plane, dedicated workers, MachineHealthChecks, node pressure, kubelet version consistency, cluster autoscaling
- **Access Control (6)**: Default SA privileges, overprivileged bindings, wildcard rules, stale bindings, namespace isolation, automount tokens
- **Identity (6)**: Identity providers, kubeadmin removal, cluster-admin audit, SA privileges, inactive users, group membership
- **Security (9)**: TLS profiles, encryption at rest, network policies, secrets management, SCC audit, image registry, container registry, kubeadmin, audit logging

### HyperShift / Hosted Control Plane Support
Automatically detects HyperShift clusters via the Infrastructure resource (`controlPlaneTopology: External`) and adapts the entire UI:

- **Persistent "Hosted" badge** in the CommandBar — visible on every view
- **"Hosted Control Plane" badge** on Pulse daily briefing with tooltip
- **Health checks adapted** — HA CP, MachineHealthChecks, and Autoscaling checks skipped (irrelevant on hosted clusters)
- **Production Readiness adapted** — etcd backup and HA CP auto-pass with "Managed by hosting provider"
- **Machine Management hidden** — MachineSets, Machines, MHCs, Autoscaling panels replaced with info block explaining NodePool model
- **API queries gated** — Machine API requests skipped entirely on HyperShift (no unnecessary 404s)
- **Snapshot tracking** — `controlPlaneTopology` captured in snapshots for drift detection

### Daily Briefing (Pulse Overview)
4-zone risk assessment visible on the Pulse view:

- **Zone 1 — Heartbeat**: Risk score ring (0-100), control plane operator status, API latency (p99), etcd leader changes, certificate expiry warnings
- **Zone 2 — Capacity**: Node/pod/deployment counts, resource quotas, PV usage, pending pods
- **Zone 3 — Attention**: Degraded operators, unhealthy nodes, critical alerts, failed pods, expiring certificates — each with remediation steps
- **Zone 4 — Activity**: Recent events, deployment rollouts, scaling activity

### Cluster Snapshots & Comparison
Capture a point-in-time snapshot of your cluster state (ClusterVersion, nodes, operators, CRDs, storage classes, RBAC, config, topology). Compare any two snapshots field-by-field to find what changed — operators upgraded, CRDs added/removed, RBAC changes, config drift. Stored in localStorage (max 10 snapshots).

### Deployment Rollback
Every Deployment detail view shows revision history with container image diffs and ReplicaSet comparison. One-click rollback with ConfirmDialog — no kubectl required.

### Pod/Node Terminal
Interactive WebSocket exec terminal with GitHub-dark theme. Command history, copy output, clear, command suggestions. For nodes: privileged debug pod with host filesystem access.

### Dry-Run Validation
Server-side dry-run panel validates YAML changes before applying. Shows what would change, catches validation errors, and prevents accidental misconfigurations.

### Resource Creation (5 Modes)
The Create view offers 5 tabs: Quick Deploy (image + name), Templates (30 resource templates), Helm (real repo integration with validated release names), Import YAML (paste or upload), and Installed operators.

### Dock Panel
Resizable bottom panel for terminal and log sessions. Minimize, close, or drag-resize. IDE-like experience for debugging workflows.

### Cluster Timeline
Event timeline with configurable time ranges (1h/6h/24h), warning/normal severity filters, namespace filtering, and clickable resource links. Available as a tab in Admin view.

### Workload Health on Detail Views
Every Deployment, StatefulSet, and DaemonSet detail view shows per-container health checks: resource limits, resource requests, liveness probes, readiness probes, HA replicas, update strategy, and security context (runAsNonRoot, privilege escalation, capabilities). Expandable rows show probe descriptions.

### Builds
BuildConfigs with one-click trigger, average build duration, last build status. Builds table with status, strategy, duration, timestamps. In-progress and failed builds panels. ImageStreams with tag badges.

### Cluster Config (10 Editable Sections)
OAuth, Proxy, Image, Ingress, Scheduler, API Server (full editors). DNS (warning: breaks routing), Network (warning: cluster disruption), FeatureGate (warning: irreversible), Console (product name, logo, route, statuspage).

### Cluster Upgrades
Pre-update checklist (nodes ready, operators healthy, channel, etcd backup, PDBs), ClusterVersion conditions (Progressing/Failing banners), version skip indicators, risk badges, duration estimates, per-operator update progress during rolling upgrade, history with duration. HyperShift-aware — etcd backup check auto-passes on hosted clusters.

### Operator Catalog & Lifecycle
Browse 500+ operators. One-click install with 4-step progress tracking. Post-install guidance for 9+ operators. Full uninstall flow. Channel selector, namespace auto-suggestion. Helm install with validated release names and `--repo` flag (no shell injection).

### Alerts & Silence Management
Severity filters (Critical/Warning/Info), group by namespace or alertname, firing duration display, silenced indicators, runbook links, silence creation from any alert, silence expiration with confirmation.

### User Management & Impersonation
Users, groups, service accounts with role bindings. One-click impersonation — all API requests include `Impersonate-User` headers (CRLF-sanitized). Amber banner shows active impersonation across all views.

### Auto-Generated Resource Tables
Every resource type gets sortable columns, search, per-column filters, bulk delete, keyboard navigation (j/k), CSV/JSON export, Edit YAML + Delete on every row, and inline scale controls for deployments.

### Smart Diagnosis with Log Analysis
10 error patterns detected from pod logs: Permission denied, Connection refused, OOM, DNS failure, read-only filesystem, wrong architecture — each with specific fix suggestions.

### YAML Editor
CodeMirror with K8s autocomplete, YAML linting, Schema panel (from CRD OpenAPI), 71 context-aware sub-snippets (insert at cursor), 30 full resource templates, inline diff view, keyboard shortcuts help. Impersonation headers included on all save operations.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Log in to your cluster
oc login --server=https://api.your-cluster.example.com:6443

# Start the API proxy
oc proxy --port=8001 &

# Copy the env example and configure for your cluster
# (optional — needed for Prometheus/Alertmanager proxying in dev)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your cluster's Thanos and Alertmanager route URLs

# Start the dev server (port 9000)
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:9000. Clear `openshiftpulse-ui-storage` from localStorage on first run to get default pinned tabs.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `K8S_API_URL` | No | `http://localhost:8001` | K8s API proxy target (via `oc proxy`) |
| `THANOS_URL` | No | *(disabled)* | Thanos Querier route URL for Prometheus proxy |
| `ALERTMANAGER_URL` | No | *(disabled)* | Alertmanager route URL |
| `CONSOLE_URL` | No | *(auto-detected)* | OpenShift Console URL for Helm API proxy |
| `OC_TOKEN` | No | *(auto-detected)* | Override for `oc whoami -t` token |

## Deploy to OpenShift

### First-time setup

```bash
# Log in to your cluster
oc login --server=https://api.your-cluster.example.com:6443

# Generate OAuth secrets
# - Client secret: any length, used for OAuthClient authentication
# - Cookie secret: must be exactly 16, 24, or 32 bytes for AES (required when pass_access_token=true)
CLIENT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n')
COOKIE_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 16)  # 32 hex chars = 16 bytes

# Create namespace and secrets
oc create namespace openshiftpulse
oc create secret generic openshiftpulse-oauth-secrets \
  --from-literal=client-secret="$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --from-literal=cookie-secret="$COOKIE_SECRET" \
  -n openshiftpulse

# Apply deployment manifests (creates ServiceAccount, RBAC, OAuthClient,
# ConfigMap, Deployment, PDB, ResourceQuota, LimitRange, Service, Route)
oc apply -f deploy/deployment.yaml

# Patch the OAuthClient with the generated client secret
oc patch oauthclient openshiftpulse \
  -p "{\"secret\":\"$CLIENT_SECRET\"}"

# Create a BuildConfig for binary builds
oc new-build --binary --name=openshiftpulse --to=openshiftpulse:latest -n openshiftpulse

# Build and deploy
npm run build
oc start-build openshiftpulse --from-dir=. --follow -n openshiftpulse

# Update the OAuthClient redirectURI to match your cluster's route
ROUTE=$(oc get route openshiftpulse -n openshiftpulse -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
oc patch oauthclient openshiftpulse --type merge \
  -p "{\"redirectURIs\":[\"https://${ROUTE}/oauth/callback\"]}"

# Restart to pick up the new image
oc rollout restart deployment/openshiftpulse -n openshiftpulse
```

### Quick redeploy (one-liner)

```bash
npm run build && oc start-build openshiftpulse --from-dir=. --follow -n openshiftpulse && oc rollout restart deployment/openshiftpulse -n openshiftpulse
```

### Security Model

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **User authentication** | OAuth proxy sidecar with OAuthClient (`user:full` scope — required for write operations) |
| **User authorization** | User's OAuth token forwarded via `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` header to K8s API |
| **Service account** | Minimal ClusterRole (`openshiftpulse-reader`) with read-only access + token review for OAuth proxy |
| **Secrets** | OAuth client secret and cookie secret mounted from a K8s Secret via files (`--client-secret-file`, `--cookie-secret-file`) |
| **Container security** | `runAsNonRoot`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, drop ALL capabilities, seccomp RuntimeDefault |
| **TLS verification** | `proxy_ssl_verify on` with `ca.crt` for K8s API, `service-ca.crt` for Prometheus/Alertmanager |
| **HTTP headers** | CSP (`default-src 'self'`), X-Frame-Options DENY, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, Referrer-Policy |
| **Input validation** | Helm release names validated (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,52}$`), PromQL sanitized, CRLF stripped from impersonation headers, regex escaped in log search |
| **SSRF protection** | Dev proxy validates URL protocol, blocks private/internal IPs |
| **Resource limits** | ResourceQuota (10 pods, 1 CPU, 1Gi memory) and LimitRange (per-container defaults and maximums) |

### Security Audit Results

A comprehensive security audit was performed covering authentication, injection vulnerabilities, sensitive data exposure, API security, deployment security, and client-side security. All 15 findings (1 critical, 4 high, 7 medium, 3 low) have been resolved:

| Severity | Finding | Resolution |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Critical | Helm command injection via `sh -c` | Validate release names, use array args with `--repo` flag |
| High | SSRF in dev proxy | Validate URL protocol, block private/link-local IPs |
| High | Impersonation CRLF injection | Strip `\r\n` from all impersonation header values |
| High | Missing nginx security headers | Added CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, nosniff, Referrer-Policy |
| High | `proxy_ssl_verify off` | Enabled with correct CA certs (`ca.crt` for API, `service-ca.crt` for monitoring) |
| Medium | Prometheus label path injection | Validate label names against `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$` |
| Medium | Path traversal in `buildApiPathFromResource` | Apply `sanitizePathSegment` to namespace and name |
| Medium | Node log file path traversal | Validate filenames against `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$` |
| Medium | RegExp DoS in log search | Escape regex special chars before `new RegExp()` |
| Medium | Missing `readOnlyRootFilesystem` | Added to both containers with emptyDir for writable paths |
| Medium | Placeholder secrets in manifest | Documented generation steps, added deployment validation |
| Medium | Broad `user:full` OAuth scope | Documented requirement (app performs write operations) |
| Low | Impersonation header format | Fixed to comma-separated `Impersonate-Group`, sanitized CRLF |
| Low | YAML editor missing impersonation | Added `getImpersonationHeaders()` to GET and PUT requests |
| Low | Token logging risk in dev | Documented in `.env.example` |

### What the deployment includes

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **OAuth proxy** | Sidecar with explicit OAuthClient, `user:full` scope, per-user authentication |
| **nginx** | Reverse proxy forwarding user's `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` to K8s API, Prometheus, Alertmanager |
| **2 replicas** | PodDisruptionBudget (minAvailable: 1), topology spread across nodes |
| **Zero-downtime** | RollingUpdate with maxUnavailable: 0 |
| **Minimal RBAC** | Scoped ClusterRole with read-only access + token review — user actions use the user's own token |
| **ResourceQuota** | 10 pods, 1 CPU / 1Gi memory requests, 2 CPU / 2Gi limits, 50 configmaps, 20 secrets |
| **LimitRange** | Default 200m/256Mi per container, max 1 CPU/1Gi |
| **Security hardening** | readOnlyRootFilesystem, CSP headers, TLS verification, non-root containers |

### Troubleshooting

- **503 on login page**: Delete the TLS secret and re-add the `serving-cert-secret-name` annotation on the Service to trigger service-ca regeneration
- **403 on API calls**: Ensure the OAuthClient has `user:full` in `scopeRestrictions` — SA-based OAuth clients cannot use this scope
- **oauth-proxy crash (tokenreviews forbidden)**: The ClusterRole needs `tokenreviews` and `subjectaccessreviews` create permissions — re-apply `deploy/deployment.yaml`
- **oauth-proxy crash (cookie_secret must be 16/24/32 bytes)**: Regenerate cookie secret with `openssl rand -hex 16` (not base64)
- **Metrics blank (SSL certificate verify error)**: Prometheus/Alertmanager use service-ca certs — ensure nginx uses `service-ca.crt` (not `ca.crt`) for those upstreams
- **Build stuck/pending**: Check configmap quota (`oc get resourcequota -n openshiftpulse`) — builds need headroom for temp configmaps (set ≥50)
- **Pods not scheduling**: Check PDB and topology constraints — need ≥2 nodes for topology spread
